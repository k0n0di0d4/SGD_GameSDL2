# SGD_GameSDL2
Game.exe is located in build, cpp files and header are located in src
This is a very simple game that is using simple gravity mechanics (with the floor being a huge collision box), you can move using arrows and jump using space. Game plays music, and you can access other "levels"(just other pictures) by going at the end of the map.
There is some music played in the background and the whole Game is made in SDL2 library.
All "art" is made by me by drawing in paint.
That's all.
